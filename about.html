<p class="p4"><span class="s1">ASIDE.IO is A Salesforce IDE that is fast, free, and always available. It is full-featured and supports the entire Salesforce development cycle from writing code, to running unit tests, querying/managing data, and deploying the resulting application.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There is no download required to start using ASIDE.IO, it lives in the cloud and is happy to be up there. Having Salesforce development tools in the cloud is a natural extension of the code and compiler being stored there. Eliminating a dependency on local workspaces of code already stored in the cloud reduces save conflicts and lost code because you are working against the source and not a copy of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">ASIDE.IO is not the product of a company; it has been designed, developed, and maintained solely by me, Phil Rymek (<a href="https://twitter.com/philrymek"><span class="s5">Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-rymek-a8517398/"><span class="s5">LinkedIn</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/fillip"><span class="s5">GitHub</span></a>), as my hobby project over the course of many years. I sincerely hope you like it and thank you for using it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>History</b></span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Created in early 2012, ASIDE.IO started off as a simple experiment. I wanted to know if you could execute Apex code from Apex code, similar to JavaScriptâ€™s eval function. After a bit of research I found out it was possible by calling Force.com APIs to execute anonymous from Apex code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From here the next logical step for me was to throw a UI on top of my shiny new Apex eval function. It didnâ€™t take long for me to find the amazing <a href="https://ace.c9.io/"><span class="s5">ACE Editor</span></a> and hook it up to the code I had written. While crude, the result was exciting, and invigorated me to see what else I could create. From here d3v (pronounced â€œdevâ€, as in â€œdeveloperâ€) was born, a Visualforce page that had some basic functionality to aid me in my daily tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As d3v gained more functionality, I had a blast using and building it, but wanted to open it up to a larger audience. At this point Salesforce had acquired Heroku so it seemed like the logical place for me to host d3v. From here there was a long transition process as I ported d3v over to Heroku, translated an Apex backend into Ruby, and opened d3v up to the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Even as d3v became more capable, there werenâ€™t many people using it. At that point it performed well, but was ugly and had a stupid name. In an attempt to get more users and right these wrongs, many changes were made: d3v was given a new interface, many bugs were fixed, and it was relaunched as ASIDE.IO in February 2014.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The rebranding was successful â€“ on day 1 more people used ASIDE.IO than had ever used d3v. Over time ASIDE.IO has continued to gain more popularity and functionality, and turned into the full-featured Salesforce development tool that it is today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
